# LoL Set Builder
League of Legends is one of the most popular games in the world. When I built this app, there were third-party web apps that existed, but they did not work properly on mobile.
The goal of this project was to fill this gap in mobile functionality.

- Search for items
- Sort items by parameters such as gold cost, or attack damage
- Name your item set
- Export your item set as a file, or copy it to the clipboard. Both can be imported into League of Legends.
- Responsive web app

## Technologies
- JavaScript
- HTML + SCSS
- React
- MVC pattern
- Fetches item data from DataDragon API
